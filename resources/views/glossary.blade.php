        <h3 class="text-center">GLOSSARY</h3>
        <br>
    <p><strong>Advance Systems</strong> - To ensure optimal performance from the drills, maintaining proper contact between the bits and the rock is crucial, especially when the piston transmits energy through impact.</p>
    <p><strong>Ammonium Gelatin</strong> - Also known as special or extra gelatin, is a type of dynamite where some of the nitroglycerin and sodium nitrate are replaced with ammonium nitrate.</p>
    <p><strong>Ammonium Nitrate Fuel Oil (ANFO)</strong> - A blasting agent consisting of ~94% ammonium nitrate and ~6% fuel oil. It is the most commonly used blasting agent.</p>
    <p><strong>Bench blasting</strong> – The best method for rock blasting due to the presence of a free face for material projection and systematic work organization.</p>
    <p><strong>Binary Explosives</strong> - An explosive based on two nonexplosive ingredients, such as nitromethane and ammonium nitrate, which are shipped and stored separately and mixed at the jobsite to form a high explosive.</p>
    <p><strong>Blasting</strong> - Occurs in two phases, primary blasting and secondary blasting. Primary blasting involves breaking down of in-situ rock in development and stoping as well as by drilling holes in rocks. Secondary blasting is performed to get rid of overburden.</p>
    <p><strong>Blastholes</strong> - Filled with either package or bulk explosives.</p>
    <p><strong>Blasting Agent (BA)</strong> - A mixture consisting of a fuel and oxidizer, intended for blasting but otherwise not and explosive (cannot be detonated with a No.8 blasting cap).</p>
    <p><strong>Burn Cut</strong> - A series of parallel holes are drilled closely spaced at right angles to the face.</p>
    <p><strong>Couplings</strong> - Couplings are used to link extension rods together until the desired length is achieved, ensuring proper alignment for effective energy transmission.</p>
    <p><strong>Detonating cords</strong> - Any device containing a detonating charge that is used to initiate an explosive, but is not limited to, blasting caps, electric blasting caps, and nonelectric instantaneous or delay blasting caps.</p>
    <p><strong>Detonator</strong> - Any device containing a detonating charge that is used to initiate an explosive. Includes, but is not limited to, blasting caps, electric blasting caps, and nonelectric instantaneous or delay blasting caps.</p>
    <p><strong>Down the Hole Hammer (DTH)</strong> - Percussion is directly applied to the drill bit, while rotation occurs externally. The piston is driven pneumatically, and rotation can be achieved using hydraulic rock rigs or pneumatic drilling rigs.</p>
    <p><strong>Downward Drilling</strong> - Involves long-hole drilling techniques like pilot hole cutting, crater cutting, 'VCR' cut (Vertical Crater Retreat), and the full-face method.</p>
    <p><strong>Drill Steel</strong> - The sections extending from the drill chuck typically consist of rods, bars, and pipes.</p>
    <p><strong>Drilling Pattern</strong> - The arrangement of drill holes is essential for achieving the desired blasting results by ensuring the correct distribution of explosives in the rock.</p>
    <p><strong>Drilling</strong> – Is a mechanical technique where holes or voids are made in different materials using a drill bit or similar cutting tools. This process usually involves rotating or striking the drill bit to enable it to pierce the material and extract material in the shape of chips or debris.</p>
    <p><strong>Drag Cut</strong> - The drag cut is particularly suitable in small sectional drifts where a pull of up to 1 m is very useful.</p>
    <p><strong>Emulsion Explosives</strong> - An explosives material containing substantial amounts of oxidizers suspended in water droplets surrounded by an immiscible fuel. Similar to a slurry in some respects.</p>
    <p><strong>Explosives</strong> - Any chemical compound, mixture or device whose primary or common purpose is to function by explosion.</p>
    <p><strong>Feed, or thrust load</strong> - To keep the drill bit in contact with the rock, a thrust load or feed force is exerted on the drill string.</p>
    <p><strong>Flushing</strong> - The process of removing drill cuttings from the blasthole.</p>
    <p><strong>Fumes</strong> - The detonation of any commercial explosive produces steam nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and eventually, solids and liquids.</p>
    <p><strong>Gelatin Dynamite</strong> - A highly water-resistant dynamite with a gelatinous consistency derived by the combination of nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose.</p>
    <p><strong>Manual Drilling</strong> - Involves the use of lightweight equipment handheld by drillers, typically in small-scale operations where the size constraints or cost considerations make the use of other machinery impractical.</p>
    <p><strong>Mechanized Drilling</strong> - Utilizes equipment mounted on rigs, allowing operators to manage all drilling parameters conveniently from a comfortable position.</p>
    <p><strong>Overbreak</strong> - Refers to the excessive removal of rock beyond the desired excavation boundary.</p>
    <p><strong>Percussion</strong> - The shock waves created by the piston's repeated impacts are transferred to the bit through the drill steel (in top hammer) or directly onto it (down the hole).</p>
    <p><strong>Powder Factor</strong> - Another interesting and sometimes confusing aspect is powder factor. Powder factor influence can be observed in extreme situations and close to the optimum level in bench blasting.</p>
    <p><strong>Pyramid or Diamond Cut</strong> - The pyramid or diamond cut is a variation of the wedge cut where the blastholes for the initial cavity may have a line of symmetry along horizontal axis as well as the vertical axis.</p>
    <p><strong>Rase Driving</strong> - Raises are smaller excavations inclined at angles greater than 45 degrees. Raise driving, a prevalent technique in mining, entails constructing passages of varying lengths, occasionally surpassing 100 meters.</p>
    <p><strong>Rock drilling</strong> - Serves as the initial step aimed at creating holes in rock masses with the appropriate shape and distribution to accommodate explosive charges and their initiating devices.</p>
    <p><strong>Rock supports</strong> – Vital for rock reinforcement in underground and surface operations, involving bolting or cementing cables where drilling initiates the process.</p>
    <p><strong>Rotation</strong> - Rotation involves turning the bit to ensure impacts occur on the rock from various angles.</p>
    <p><strong>Rotary methods</strong> - These are categorized based on the penetration mechanism: crushing with tricones for medium to hard rocks and cutting with drag bits for soft rocks.</p>
    <p><strong>Rotary-percussive methods</strong> - These are commonly employed in various rock types, utilizing top hammer and down-the-hole hammer techniques.</p>
    <p><strong>Shaft sinking</strong> – The procedure of digging a vertical or inclined passage (shaft) to reach underground mineral reserves. This process encompasses various activities aimed at creating a safe and efficient pathway for miners, equipment, and materials to move between surface and underground operations.</p>
    <p><strong>Shank Adaptors</strong> - These components are affixed to the rock drill chuck to transmit impact energy to the rods, rotation torque, and feed force effectively.</p>
    <p><strong>Straight Gelatin</strong> – Is the most powerful nitroglycerin-based explosive and is known for its waterproof properties.</p>
    <p><strong>Surveying</strong> - Involves the measurement and mapping of underground excavations to ensure they conform to design specifications. Surveying is crucial for maintaining accurate tunnel dimensions, alignment, and grade.</p>
    <p><strong>Top Hammer</strong> - In top hammer drills, both rotational and percussive actions take place outside the blast hole and are transmitted to the drill bit via the shank adaptor and drill steel. The hammers can be powered by hydraulic rock rigs or pneumatic drilling rigs.</p>
    <p><strong>Underbreak</strong> - Refers to the insufficient removal of rock, leaving some areas unbroken.</p>
    <p><strong>Upward Drilling</strong> - Typically carried out manually using a Jora lift or with the assistance of an Alimak platform.</p>
    <p><strong>Ventilating</strong> - Done by using so-called air-ducting systems, long steel or plastic pipes, which are attached to the roof of the tunnel and blow fresh air onto the working face. This gives rise to localized excess pressure and the bad air is pushed towards the tunnel exit.</p>
    <p><strong>Wedge Cut or V-cut</strong> - This type of cut is particularly effective for large-sized drifts with well-laminated or fissured rocks.</p>
